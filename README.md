# Welcome to the Klipper project!

## This is a fork of the original Klipper project for my own hacking/configuring.

### Goals:

#### 1) Upgrade to Python3
#### 2) Offload some of the heavier computation to Rust or C for better efficiency on lower-end hardware
#### 3) Add some AI to be able to monitor prints via cam setups and determine the quality of the print/recommend changes/stop if emergency
#### 4) Build a configurator tool to make configuration less of a pain in the ass

More to come... Way more :)
